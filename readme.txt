	* ‘Random Quote’ block that functions similarly to the Random Quote widget, with additional presentation options.
* **Shortcode**: All quotes or a set of quotes can be displayed on a WordPress page by placing a `[quotcoll]`shortcode. Few examples are provided below. For more examples and the full list of arguments, visit the [Plugin Home Page](http://srinig.com/wordpress/plugins/quotes-collection/).
	* Placing `[quotcoll]` in the page displays all quotes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How to hide the 'Next quote »' link in the widget? =

You can do this by turning off the 'Ajax Refresh' feature in widget options.

= How to change the link text from 'Next quote »' to something else? =

This text can be changed from *Quotes Collection -> Options* in your WordPress admin area

= The 'Next quote »' link is not working. Why? =

Make sure your theme's header.php file has the code `<?php wp_head(); ?>` just before `</head>`. If you still experience the problem, [contact](http://srinig.com/wordpress/contact/) the plugin author.

= I have added a number of quotes, but some of the quotes never get displayed in the widget. Why? =

If you want all of the quotes to display, make sure all all the quotes fall within the 'Character limit'. There is an option named 'Character limit' for the widget (bottom most, under the 'advanced options') with a default value of '500'. The value can be changed, or simply removed and the field left blank so that none of the quotes get filtered out based on length.

= I have a long list of quotes, and the `[quotcoll]` shortcode puts all of the quotes in a single page. Is there a way to introduce pagination and break the long list of quotes into different pages? =

Yes, pagination is supporterd in versions 1.5 and greater. `paging` and `limit_per_page` attributes can be used to achieve this. For example, `[quotcoll paging=true limit_per_page=30]` will introduce pagination with a maximum of 30 quotes per page.

= Can an existing shortcode be converted to a Gutenberg block? =

Yes, the existing shortcode will appear as 'Classic' block in the block editor interface. All you need to do is click on the 'More options' (three vertical dots on the top right corner) and click 'Convert to Blocks' in order to convert the shortcode into a 'Quotes' block.
